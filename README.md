# Shake & Taste
Use of a free cocktail API (TheCocktailDB.com) to retrieve and display data.


Dark/Light mode in JavaScript that matches with the OS preferences.

Search your favorite drink by name/by category and look for ingredients and instructions.

The “Lab” page tests the idea of creating your own cocktail with the addition of certain ingredients. Each time an ingredient is clicked, a dose of that ingredient is added to the glass. 
Ingredients can be removed separately, and it's also possible to empty the glass all at once. 
When the “shake” button is clicked, the glass shakes to produce the desired cocktail. I would have liked to match the color of the produced cocktail to that of the ingredients mixed, but for lack of time, I simply used another color.
